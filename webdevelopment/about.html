                Hi, my name is LeeAnn Lin. I am currently a sophomore in College of Engineering at the University of Missouri - Columbia, 
                majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My expected graduation date is the summer of 2027. With my field of study, 
                I would like to apply my knowledge to create innovative and meaningful solutions that will make a real world impact. 
                
                <br><br>I am passionate about continuously learning new skills, building projects, and collaborating with others to share ideas and grow together. 
                In my free time, I really enjoy crocheting, joining tech clubs, and expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects. My goal is to keep learning, 
                growing, and make a difference by applying my knowledge to real world challenges. 
                
                <br><br>One of my <em>favorite</em> sayings is, 
                <blockquote><h3><em><b>“Hard work does not necessarily lead to success, but giving up will definitely lead to failure”.</b></em></h3></blockquote>
