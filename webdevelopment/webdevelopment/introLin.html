        Hello!
        Â My name is LeeAnn Lin. I'm a sophomore here at Mizzou, studying in Computer Science with a minor in Math. I previous made a really simple website with my friends and that is about it for my experience with HTML and CSS. My expectations for this course is to learn the skills for making a website that able to make more on my own later in my life. I'm hoping to be able to get familiar with HTML and CSS coding language and able to apply the knowledge in my future career. During my free time, I like to crochet. In the past few month, I have made several projects. I also like to spend time with my friends outside of class.
