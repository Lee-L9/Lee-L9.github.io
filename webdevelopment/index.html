            <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a space to showcase my journey in computer science, highlighting projects and experiences in software engineering. 
                My goal is to use my skills to solve real world problems, at the same time, promoting inclusivity in tech. Here, you will find a collection of projects that shows my abilities in coding, 
                problem solving, and creative thinking. Outside of computing, I think highly of collaboration and knowledge sharing, it could be through clubs, mentorship, or teamwork. 
                I hope this website will give you a deeper understanding of my progress, my passion and make connections with people that are like-minded. No matter if you are here to check out my journey, 
                collaborate, or just get to know me, feel free to look around and reach out to me. We might be able to create something meaningful together.
