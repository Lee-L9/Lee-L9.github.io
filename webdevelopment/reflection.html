        <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            Throughout my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Missouri - Columbia, I have discovered a 
            deep passion for using my computing skills to make practical applications. When I first started in the field, I 
            had a really broad understanding of what computer scientists do, all I thought about was developing games for 
            people to play. However, as I learn more about computer science, I understand that developing games is only a 
            small part of the tech field. With each project I have done, I'm learning new skills and getting experience with 
            coding. As I continue my studies, my goal is to build a career that blends my skills in computer science with my 
            passion for solving problems. I believe that with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, I can 
            take new challenges and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Through my various projects and club involvement, I have gained hands-on experience in software development, database 
            management, and leadership. Working on the Pet Adoption Application allowed me to explore Swift and mobile app 
            development, where I learned how to display and manage pet data efficiently. While I successfully built a functional 
            model, I realized the importance of JSON files for data storage and retrieval. I also wish I had deeper expertise in 
            Swift to enhance user interactions and deploy the app on real devices rather than just a built-in simulator. This 
            project reinforced my interest in app development and inspired me to improve my knowledge of backend integration 
            for interactive applications. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Similarly, the Transaction Database Application expanded my understanding of MySQL and Python integration for real-world 
            applications. Building a secure login system and enabling database interactions strengthened my grasp of SQL queries 
            and database security practices. However, the limitation of displaying information in the terminal rather than a 
            graphical user interface made me realize the importance of user experience (UX) design. In the future, I would like 
            to improve this project by developing a more interactive UI, allowing users to easily manage their transactions 
            through a web-based or desktop application. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Beyond technical skills, my role in Develop[Her] has been an invaluable leadership experience. As Vice President, I 
            have honed my abilities in public speaking, networking, and organizational management. Recruiting new members and 
            maintaining the clubâ€™s presence within the university has allowed me to contribute to fostering an inclusive community 
            for women in tech. This experience has strengthened my confidence in leadership and communication, skills that are 
            essential in both academic and professional settings. Moving forward, I hope to continue mentoring and empowering 
            others in the tech field while refining my technical and problem-solving skills through new projects and challenges.
        </p>
