        <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            Throughout my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Missouri - Columbia, I have discovered a 
            deep passion for using my computing skills to make practical applications. When I first started in the field, I 
            had a really broad understanding of what computer scientists do, all I thought about was developing games for 
            people to play. However, as I learn more about computer science, I understand that developing games is only a 
            small part of the tech field. With each project I have done, Iâ€™m learning new skills and getting experience with 
            coding. As I continue my studies, my goal is to build a career that blends my skills in computer science with my 
            passion for solving problems. I believe that with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, I can 
            take new challenges and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
