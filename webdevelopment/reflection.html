                        Throughout my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Missouri - Columbia, I have discovered 
                        a deep passion for using my computing skills to create practical applications. When I first entered the field, 
                        my understanding of computer science was quite broad, and I primarily associated it with developing games for 
                        people to play. However, as I have progressed in my studies, I have come to realize that game development is just 
                        a small part of the vast technology landscape. Computer science is a powerful tool that can be applied to numerous 
                        industries, from artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, and I am eager to explore the many ways it can be used 
                        to solve real-world problems.

                <div class="ref2">
                    <p class="indent">
                        With each project I undertake, I continue to expand my skill set and gain valuable experience in coding and software 
                        development. Working on projects has not only strengthened my technical abilities but has also taught me the importance 
                        of problem-solving, collaboration, and creativity. Whether it's analyzing music playlists, building applications, 
                        or working with data, I find great satisfaction in turning ideas into functioning programs. These hands-on experiences 
                        have reinforced my passion for technology and have given me confidence in my ability to tackle complex challenges.

                    <p class="indent">
                        As I continue my studies, my goal is to build a career that blends my skills in computer science with my passion for 
                        problem-solving. I am particularly interested in fields such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, and 
                        data science, where I can develop innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact. I believe that technology has 
                        the power to improve lives, and I am excited to be part of a field that constantly evolves and pushes the limits of 
                        what is possible.

                    <p class="indent">
                        With a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to 
                        the advancement of technology. I am committed to continuous learning, growing my expertise, and staying adaptable in 
                        an ever-changing field. While hard work does not necessarily guarantee success, I firmly believe that perseverance and 
                        dedication will open doors to new opportunities. I look forward to seeing where my journey in computer science takes 
                        me and to making a difference through my work.
